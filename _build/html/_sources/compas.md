# COMPAS Algorithm
**COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions)** is a risk assessment tool that is used in the criminal justice system to **predict the likelihood of an individual committing a crime in the future.** It is used by probation officers, parole boards, and other criminal justice agencies to make decisions about the supervision, treatment, and rehabilitation of offenders. 

## The Algorithm
The algorithm behind COMPAS is proprietary, so the exact details of how it works are **not publicly available**. However, it is known that the tool uses **data from an individual's criminal history and other background information to produce a score indicating the likelihood of that person committing a crime in the future.** This information may include factors such as the individual's age, gender, race, and prior criminal history, as well as information about the circumstances of their current offense. Sample questions can be seen [here](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2702103-Sample-Risk-Assessment-COMPAS-CORE.html#document/p4/a296597).

The COMPAS algorithm produces two main types of risk assessments: 
* **Recidivism risk assessment**: This assessment is specifically designed to predict the likelihood of an individual committing another crime in the future. It is based on data from the individual's criminal history and other background information, and takes into account factors such as the severity of their current offense, their age, gender, race, and prior criminal history.

* **General risk assessment**: This assessment is broader in scope and is designed to predict the likelihood of an individual engaging in a range of negative behaviors, including but not limited to criminal activity. It may take into account a wider range of factors than the recidivism risk assessment, such as the individual's social and economic circumstances, their mental and physical health, and their family and support network.

## How COMPAS score is used
Once this data has been collected, the algorithm uses machine learning techniques to analyze the data and produce a score indicating the likelihood of the individual committing a crime in the future. This score is then used to guide decisions about how best to manage the individual's case, such as whether to release them on parole, what types of rehabilitation or treatment programs they should participate in, and so on.
